= About =
This project aims to solve simple problem : backup rotating.

= How it should work =

Simple using scenario

== Pickup dir ==

New directories consisting of backups should be put into backups/pickup dir.
Directory name should be formated as ISO8601 time.
This will be used as backup creation time during processing.

== Storing dirs ==

In conifg.php you can configure many storing dirs.
Directories from the pickup dir will be linked to the storing dirs according to storing-dir configuration.

=== Storing dir configuration ===

* group - string consisting of fields that will be used to build ordering token. Each symbol is translated to corresponding time part as in date() function.
* offset - offset of the directory - time to add to each backup in seconds
* count - count of backups kept in that directory

= TODO =
- Rotating Backups
- Removing backups over count
- 
== Wish list==

- Generating and keeping checksums 
- Checking checksums

- Signing / checking signatures on checksums file ( GPG - signatures)

- Running backup checks after pickup
- Scheduling additional checks after some time
